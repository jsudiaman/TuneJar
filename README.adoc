This repo is messy. Just bear with it for now, I'll get to cleaning it up.


= Start up code for using gradle

Run the following in Terminal:

----
cd <PATH_TO_THIS_FOLDER>
gradlew run # Run your application from the command line
gradlew eclipse # Get things going in Eclipse
----

You can now import your project in eclipse.

You can use http://search.maven.org[Maven Central] to find libraries to include into your project.
Also, http://libraries.io/[Find great open source libraries here].
