### What is TuneJar?
TuneJar (powered by **Java**) is a music player that is **lightweight**, **cross-platform**, and best of all, **open source**.

### Why TuneJar?
Here's a few reasons why TuneJar might just be the right player for you.  

- Library management is quick and painless. Simply choose which folders to track and let TuneJar do the hard work for you.
- M3U playlists can be created, imported (e.g. from iTunes), and exported for use in other music players.
- Metadata (Title/Artist/Album) can be edited directly.
- TuneJar is skinnable via CSS and will ship with multiple premade themes.

Soon there will be a Wiki set up with more detailed information. Stay tuned!
