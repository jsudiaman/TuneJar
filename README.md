### What is TuneJar?
TuneJar is a music player that is **lightweight**, **cross-platform**, and best of all, **open source**.

### Why TuneJar?
Here's a few reasons why TuneJar might just be the right program for you.  

- M3U playlists can be created, imported (e.g. from iTunes), and exported for use in other music players.
- Metadata (title, artist, and album) can be edited directly.
- You may customize TuneJar's appeareance to your heart's content using [CSS](https://github.com/sudiamanj/TuneJar/blob/master/src/main/resources/viewcontroller/DarkTheme.css).

Upon pre-release, there will be a Wiki set up with more detailed information. Stay tuned!
